# The Virtual Museum by Culture Couch Potatoes

This application provides an interactive, virtual tour of selected museum exhibits.
The user is able to navigate around a virtual museum hall, select an exhibit and click to see key information about it.
The museum hall and exhibits are displayed in 3D to re-create the experience of visiting a museum, but from the comfort and safety of your browser.
